 <p><span> CAMILLE </span>started seriously thinking about how kids access education out of memory of a question she was asked in the fourth grade. A girl in her class wanted to know how Camille got to school. Did she take the bus or did she walk to their elementary school? It was a simple question, but it held a lot of weight for Camille and the St. Louis area as a whole. Camille's hometown is home to the nation's longest running school desegregation program. As a black girl, Camille qualified for the program. And if she rode the bus to school, that would mean she was in it. But she wasn't. Her family lived within her school district's boundaries. As a high school journalist, Camille wrote about this school transfer program, its ties to racist housing policies and her peers who were affected by it. Camille won the Brasler Prize — known as the scholastic equivalent to the Pulitzer — for her work. And she hasn't stopped thinking about how vulnerable children access education since.
</p>
<p>Camille currently works under the mentorship of Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Sara Ganim on a data-driven multimedia project focused on education secrecy at the Brechner Center at the University of Florida. She’s also working on a murder podcast series with Gainesville’s NPR affiliate, WUFT.</p>
<p>In the past, Camille has worked for Chalkbeat, an education news source in New York, The Trace, the Miami Herald and University of Florida’s student-run newspaper, the Independent Florida Alligator. She’s also the vice president of her college’s ambassador program and director of external communications for Project Makeover, a student-run nonprofit focused on beautifying Gainesville-area elementary schools.</p>
<p> Fitting with her fascination with education accessibility, she researched and reported an extensive cover story — a first for an intern — on that same St. Louis school desegregation program while at the Riverfront Times in 2018. </p>
<p> Camille is an-award winning journalist, thoughtful communicator and innovative team member. A hopeful champion for vulnerable children and school communities everywhere, she hopes to make an impact in the worlds of education and media. She is a student at the University of Florida and graduates in May 2021. </p>
